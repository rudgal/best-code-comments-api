Calling it\n// such would be an insult to other bad formats, such as PCX or JPEG. No, PSD\n// is an abysmal format. Having worked on this code for several weeks now, my\n// hate for PSD has grown to a raging fire that burns with the fierce passion\n// of a million suns.\n//\n// If there are two different ways of doing something, PSD will do both, in\n// different places. It will then make up three more ways no sane human would\n// think of, and do those too. PSD makes inconsistency an art form. Why, for\n// instance, did it suddenly decide that *these* particular chunks should be\n// aligned to four bytes, and that this alignement should *not* be included in\n// the size? Other chunks in other places are either unaligned, or aligned with\n// the alignment included in the size. Here, though, it is not included. Either\n// one of these three behaviours would be fine. A sane format would pick one.\n// PSD, of course, uses all three, and more.\n//\n// Trying to get data out of a PSD file is like trying to find something in the\n// attic of your eccentric old uncle who died in a freak freshwater shark\n// attack on his 58th birthday. That last detail may not be important for the\n// purposes of the simile, but at this point I am spending a lot of time\n// imagining amusing fates for the people responsible for this Rube Goldberg of\n// a file format.\n//\n// Earlier, I tried to get a hold of the latest specs for the PSD file format.\n// To do this, I had to apply to them for permission to apply to them to have\n// them consider sending me this sacred tome. This would have involved faxing\n// them a copy of some document or other, probably signed in blood. I can only\n// imagine that they make this process so difficult because they are intensely\n// ashamed of having created this abomination. I was naturally not gullible\n// enough to go through with this procedure, but if I had done so, I would have\n// printed out every single page of the spec, and set them all on fire. Were it\n// within my power, I would gather every single copy of those specs, and launch\n// them on a spaceship directly into the sun.\n//\n// PSD is not my favourite file format.",

    "content": "/*\nMajor subtleties ahead:  Most hash schemes depend on having a \"good\" hash\nfunction, in the sense of simulating randomness.  Python doesn't:  its most\nimportant hash functions (for strings and ints) are very regular in common\ncases:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; map(hash, (0, 1, 2, 3))\n[0, 1, 2, 3]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; map(hash, (\"namea\", \"nameb\", \"namec\", \"named\"))\n[-1658398457, -1658398460, -1658398459, -1658398462]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nThis isn't necessarily bad!  To the contrary, in a table of size 2**i, taking\nthe low-order i bits as the initial table index is extremely fast, and there\nare no collisions at all for dicts indexed by a contiguous range of ints.\nThe same is approximately true when keys are \"consecutive\" strings.  So this\ngives better-than-random behavior in common cases, and that's very desirable.\n\nOTOH, when collisions occur, the tendency to fill contiguous slices of the\nhash table makes a good collision resolution strategy crucial.  Taking only\nthe last i bits of the hash code is also vulnerable:  for example, consider\n[i &lt;&lt; 16 for i in range(20000)] as a set of keys.  Since ints are their own\nhash codes, and this fits in a dict of size 2**15, the last 15 bits of every\nhash code are all 0:  they *all* map to the same table index.\n\nBut catering to unusual cases should not slow the usual ones, so we just take\nthe last i bits anyway.  It's up to collision resolution to do the rest.  If\nwe *usually* find the key we're looking for on the first try (and, it turns\nout, we usually do -- the table load factor is kept under 2/3, so the odds\nare solidly in our favor), then it makes best sense to keep the initial index\ncomputation dirt cheap.\n\nThe first half of collision resolution is to visit table indices via this\nrecurrence:\n\n    j = ((5*j) + 1) mod 2**i\n\nFor any initial j in range(2**i), repeating that 2**i times generates each\nint in range(2**i) exactly once (see any text on random-number generation for\nproof).  By itself, this doesn't help much:  like linear probing (setting\nj += 1, or j -= 1, on each loop trip), it scans the table entries in a fixed\norder.  This would be bad, except that's not the only thing we do, and it's\nactually *good* in the common cases where hash keys are consecutive.  In an\nexample that's really too small to make this entirely clear, for a table of\nsize 2**3 the order of indices is:\n\n    0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 0 [and here it's repeating]\n\nIf two things come in at index 5, the first place we look after is index 2,\nnot 6, so if another comes in at index 6 the collision at 5 didn't hurt it.\nLinear probing is deadly in this case because there the fixed probe order\nis the *same* as the order consecutive keys are likely to arrive.  But it's\nextremely unlikely hash codes will follow a 5*j+1 recurrence by accident,\nand certain that consecutive hash codes do not.\n\nThe other half of the strategy is to get the other bits of the hash code\ninto play.  This is done by initializing a (unsigned) vrbl \"perturb\" to the\nfull hash code, and changing the recurrence to:\n\n    j = (5*j) + 1 + perturb;\n    perturb &gt;&gt;= PERTURB_SHIFT;\n    use j % 2**i as the next table index;\n\nNow the probe sequence depends (eventually) on every bit in the hash code,\nand the pseudo-scrambling property of recurring on 5*j+1 is more valuable,\nbecause it quickly magnifies small differences in the bits that didn't affect\nthe initial index.  Note that because perturb is unsigned, if the recurrence\nis executed often enough perturb eventually becomes and remains 0.  At that\npoint (very rarely reached) the recurrence is on (just) 5*j+1 again, and\nthat's certain to find an empty slot eventually (since it generates every int\nin range(2**i), and we make sure there's always at least one empty slot).\n\nSelecting a good value for PERTURB_SHIFT is a balancing act.  You want it\nsmall so that the high bits of the hash code continue to affect the probe\nsequence across iterations; but you want it large so that in really bad cases\nthe high-order hash bits have an effect on early iterations.  5 was \"the\nbest\" in minimizing total collisions across experiments Tim Peters ran (on\nboth normal and pathological cases), but 4 and 6 weren't significantly worse.\n\nHistorical:  Reimer Behrends contributed the idea of using a polynomial-based\napproach, using repeated multiplication by x in GF(2**n) where an irreducible\npolynomial for each table size was chosen such that x was a primitive root.\nChristian Tismer later extended that to use division by x instead, as an\nefficient way to get the high bits of the hash code into play.  This scheme\nalso gave excellent collision statistics, but was more expensive:  two\nif-tests were required inside the loop; computing \"the next\" index took about\nthe same number of operations but without as much potential parallelism\n(e.g., computing 5*j can go on at the same time as computing 1+perturb in the\nabove, and then shifting perturb can be done while the table index is being\nmasked); and the dictobject struct required a member to hold the table's\npolynomial.  In Tim's experiments the current scheme ran faster, produced\nequally good collision statistics, needed less code &amp; used less memory.\n\nTheoretical Python 2.5 headache:  hash codes are only C \"long\", but\nsizeof(Py_ssize_t) &gt; sizeof(long) may be possible.  In that case, and if a\ndict is genuinely huge, then only the slots directly reachable via indexing\nby a C long can be the first slot in a probe sequence.  The probe sequence\nwill still eventually reach every slot in the table, but the collision rate\non initial probes may be much higher than this scheme was designed for.\nGetting a hash code as fat as Py_ssize_t is the only real cure.  But in\npractice, this probably won't make a lick of difference for many years (at\nwhich point everyone will have terabytes of RAM on 64-bit boxes).\n*/",

Calling it such would be an\n    // insult to other bad formats, such as PCX or JPEG. No, PSD is an abysmal format. Having\n    // worked on this code for several weeks now, my hate for PSD has grown to a raging fire\n    // that burns with the fierce passion of a million suns.\n    // If there are two different ways of doing something, PSD will do both, in different\n    // places. It will then make up three more ways no sane human would think of, and do those\n    // too. PSD makes inconsistency an art form. Why, for instance, did it suddenly decide\n    // that *these* particular chunks should be aligned to four bytes, and that this alignement\n    // should *not* be included in the size? Other chunks in other places are either unaligned,\n    // or aligned with the alignment included in the size. Here, though, it is not included.\n    // Either one of these three behaviours would be fine. A sane format would pick one. PSD,\n    // of course, uses all three, and more.\n    // Trying to get data out of a PSD file is like trying to find something in the attic of\n    // your eccentric old uncle who died in a freak freshwater shark attack on his 58th\n    // birthday. That last detail may not be important for the purposes of the simile, but\n    // at this point I am spending a lot of time imagining amusing fates for the people\n    // responsible for this Rube Goldberg of a file format.\n    // Earlier, I tried to get a hold of the latest specs for the PSD file format. To do this,\n    // I had to apply to them for permission to apply to them to have them consider sending\n    // me this sacred tome.
